🙌Hi! I'm Xinyi Yuan, currently as a research student in [Harada Lab](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/), Osaka University, supervised by [Prof. Weiwei Wan](https://wanweiwei07.github.io/). Previously, I got my MPhil degree at [Intelligent Transportation (INTR) Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/) in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou campus)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Meixin Zhu](https://meixinzhu.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's in [Robotics Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/) from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), exploring human-robot interaction strategies for upper-limb rehabilitation in [Brain-Robot Rehabilitation Technology Lab](https://zhangmmlab.com/). From Feb. 2024 to Sep. 2024, I remotely engaged in fascinating legged robot research at the [Shang Hai AI laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) supervised by [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/).

Besides engineering, I believe that finance is another perspective for understanding what is happening in the world. So, I am working hard to become a [Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Financial_Analyst) charterholder (Progress: level 2 candidate this year). I also enjoy exploring different cities and trying out the food.

I'm pretty interested in robotics, but still new to it, and you're more than welcome to write me an email to connect (or make friends)! Let's explore the exciting world together! 🌌
