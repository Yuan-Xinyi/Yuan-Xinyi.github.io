🙌Hi! I'm Xinyi Yuan, currently pursuing my MPhil at [Intelligent Transportation (INTR) Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/) in the [System Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou campus)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Meixin Zhu](https://meixinzhu.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's in [Robotics Engineering](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/) from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm engaged in fascinating research at the [Shang Hai AI laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) remotely supervised by [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/).

I am particularly interest in interdisciplinary research. Besides engineering, I am working hard to become a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) charterholder. I also enjoy exploring different cities and trying out the food🍜.

I'm pretty interested in robotics, but still new to it, and you're more than welcome to write me an email to connect (or make friends)! Let's explore the exciting world together! 🌌
